Follow the notebooks for lineage inferrence on a Seurat object. We have provided the notebooks to reproduce the analysis. In theory the notebook is compatible with any Seurat object in combination with a spliced and unspliced matrix. 

Please follow LinInfNB.nb.html and LinInfscVelo.ipynb for the lininf algorithm. All necessary custom functions are found in the notebook.

All necessary files to reproduce the analysis are referenced in the notebooks and can be temporarily found here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xxN_wooiRjrCSbNcX7qUP7lkANt0r9hF/view?usp=sharing
